    "bio": "Welcome, I’m siddhant so from here I started when I was 12 in 8 standards. I got some suggestions from my friend and my uncle. he guides me, how things work! and very much, I learned lots of things from him. so I just started my coding session, Learning languages is not easy at all, but I just give my best. lots of thoughts are there in my mind. I got into trouble with many things. but I didn’t stop, I started taking coding sessions and advice. and growing and growing. So after that, I started web development and now I’m able to make websites and money with that, and I’m still learning, no one is perfect in the coding,",
